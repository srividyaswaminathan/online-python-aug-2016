1.What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT YEAR(charged_datetime) AS year, MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) AS month, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM billing
WHERE charged_datetime BETWEEN '2012-03-01' AND '2012-03-31'
;

2.What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT client_id, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue

FROM billing

WHERE client_id = 2;


3.What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT client_id, domain_name AS website

FROM sites

WHERE client_id = 10;

4.What query would you run to get total # of sites created each month for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT client_id, YEAR(created_datetime) AS year, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) AS month, COUNT(site_id) AS number_of_sites

FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 1
 -- client_id = 20
GROUP BY YEAR(created_datetime), MONTHNAME(created_datetime);

5.What query would you run to get the total # of leads we've generated for each of our sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT domain_name AS website,  COUNT(leads_id) AS number_of_leads, DATE_FORMAT(registered_datetime,'%M %d,%Y') AS date_of_generated

FROM leads

JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id

WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'

GROUP BY leads.site_id

ORDER BY registered_datetime;

6.What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ',clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,

    COUNT(leads_id) AS total_number_of_leads

FROM clients

LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'

GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7.What query would you run to get a list of client name and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between month 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ',clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,

    COUNT(leads_id) AS number_of_leads, MONTHNAME(registered_datetime) AS month_generated

FROM clients

LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-6-30'

GROUP BY clients.client_id, MONTHNAME(registered_datetime)

ORDER BY clients.first_name;

8.What query would you run to get a list of client name and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our client's sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ',clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,

    domain_name AS website,COUNT(leads_id) AS number_of_leads
FROM clients

LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'

GROUP BY clients.client_id, domain_name;

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ',clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,

    domain_name AS website,COUNT(leads_id) AS number_of_leads
FROM clients

LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

GROUP BY clients.client_id, domain_name;

9.Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client each month of the year.

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ',clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,

    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue, YEAR(charged_datetime) AS year, 

    MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) AS month

FROM clients

LEFT JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY clients.first_name, clients.last_name, YEAR(charged_datetime), MONTHNAME(charged_datetime);

10.Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. Add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ',clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,

    GROUP_CONCAT(domain_name SEPARATOR ' / ') AS sites
FROM clients

LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY clients.client_id;
