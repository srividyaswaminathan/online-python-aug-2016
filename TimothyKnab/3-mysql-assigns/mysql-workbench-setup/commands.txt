	SELECT *
	FROM clients
	WHERE first_name LIKE "M%"
	ORDER BY joined_datetime DESC;
	// orders clients by their joined_datetime descending while filtering for first_name starting with 'M'



	INSERT INTO clients (id, first_name, last_name, email, joined_datetime)
	VALUES (11, 'Timothy', 'Knab', 'timknab@gmail.com', NOW());
	// adds a new ID of 11, 'Timothy' 'Knab' 'timknab@gmail.com' and a current timestamp to 'clients' table


	SELECT *
