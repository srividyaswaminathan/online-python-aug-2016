Questions for Mentor

TO DO LIST FOR EXTRA PRACTICE
		-- 1. Work on RemoveDuplicates in Python
		-- 2. Try to use some slice selectors
		-- 3. Rewrite Palindome Algorithm
		-- 5. Basic 13 in Python





//////////
// Week 2 
/////////

	1. my arrays_2 algorithm solution:

		QUESTION (RESOLVED): (See arrays2 file) Remove Duplicates -- (python) How can I remove the set() from output?
		The proper usage of set()?


	2. General Python Question:

		':' and '::'  -- how are these used to assess a list? 
		QUESTION (RESOLVED): (See below) I'm a little confused on how exactly we can use these...

			Here's how it works:

			[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
			[start:end:jumpBy]  // this is the general format
			[::2] // this would jump through entire list by groups of 2
			[1:3:1] // this would retrieve items at index 1 to index 3, one item at a time



	3. QUESTION(RESOLVED): (See below) Can I chain regular javascript functions, or is this only available in jQuery?
				
			Yes you can!
			str.split('').reverse().join('')


	4. strings_02_algorithm:

		QUESTION (RESOLVED): (See below) Why are we referencing 'str.length-1' here?

			Because string.length is going to give us length of string, say if it's 'car', than it would be 3
			What we really want is the index of 'r', for example, which is string[2]
			Thus by referencing 'string.length-1', we're ensuring that we're getting the last character index of the string.
			If we used 'string.length' only, we'd likely get an index out of range error...? (something to self-investigate)


		function isPalindrome(str) {
		    for (var idx = str.length - 1; idx >= str.length / 2; idx -= 1) {   
		        if (str[idx] != str[str.length - 1 - idx]) {
		            return false;
		        }
		    }
		    return true;
		}

		"racecar"
		strings length is 7
		BUT that means the string has only 6 indices

		idx=5
		until idx=3






//////////
// Week 3
//////////

	QUESTION 1:
		
		JoiningObjects Algorithm: 

		Would like to walk through this Algorithm together.

		QUESTION(RESOLVED) (see below): if we're creating multiple objects, as in the code example below,
		is there a way to define a variable name for each object? When I tried this, I received an error.

			ANSWER TO QUESTION: You're unable to define a variable inside a list this way, I think the syntax and line breaks was confusing you and you weren't able to see the elements are nested!


			var checkedOut = [];

			function myFunction(){

				checkedOut.push([
				
							var someName = { 
							
							// QUESTION: Can I define a name for these objects? Why var give error? 

								book_Currently_Checked_Out: bookTitle,   	
								book_Checked_Out_Subject: bookSubject
							}, 
							{
								book_Checked_Out_ID: bookID, 
								book_Checked_Out_On: whenCheckedOut
							}, 
							{
								book_Checked_Out_By: userID, 
								book_Checked_Out_First_Name: userFirstName, 
								book_Checked_Out_Last_Name: userLastName
							}
				]);
			}

// Week 4-5 (break week)
////////////

	QUESTION 1:  MONTHNAME() function

		Not seeing on official SQL pages (ie, w3schools) - is there a good place to find these documented?






	QUESTION 2 (RESOLVED): Email Validation Assignment

		Can we go over this?
		strftime('%d/%m/%y %I:%M%p')


		Solution: 'string format time' essentially allows us to return a string representing the date in a specific format. Here's a link for a list of what each character represents in regards to time formatting:

			https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior





	QUESTIONS 3-6:

		From Full Friends Assignment:

		+ QUESTION 3 (RESOLVED): Can we review the concept of '[0]' for our flask variables? (See question 5 below as well as this is basically the same question!)

			Essentially, a dictionary/object is returned, and we use the [0] bucket to give us the index of 0, which is the list inside of the dictionary object.






		From Login Registration Assignment:

		+ QUESTION 4 (WILL PRACTICE): 

			Try an example of flash messaging with filtering? 
			Only go over this with mentor if you've tried this first on your own.

			(Note: I'll go ahead and try this first before I ask anything too specific..)
		



		From Login Registration Assignment:

		+ QUESTION 5 (RESOLVED): [0] bucket question, resolved above.



////////////
// Week 6
////////////

	QUESTION 1 (RESOLVED):

		How can I use `request.form` when the name of what I'm requesting has a variable name, such as "`comment` + id"?

			SOLUTION:

				Store your form in a variable, and then call to whatever key you're interested in. Here's an example.

				-----python-----

				def getForm(id):
					form = request.form
					data = {
						'name' = form['name'],
						comment = form['comment' + id] #this is where we'll get our dynamic name, ie `comment38`, if `id=38`
					}
				
				---end python---
