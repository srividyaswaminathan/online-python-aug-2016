Note that this project folder is code from following along with learning platform lessons, and is not an actual assignment. I just included them here for future reference. 

One other note, when server.py is run in this assignment, the default index page does not load-- instead navigate in the address bar to:

localhost:5000/quotes 

The quotes page will load. The reason for this setup is due to the lesson demo setup.
