###Zip Arrays into Map
Associative arrays are sometimes called maps because a key (string) maps to a value. Given two arrays, create an associative array (map) containing keys of the first, and values of the second. For `arr1 = ["abc", 3, "yo"]` and `arr2 = [42, "wassup", true]`, return `{"abc": 42, 3: "wassup", "yo": true}`.
