#Online Python

Welcome everyone! This is a repository to help track our progress moving through the learning platform.

Your first assignment is to figure out how to send me a **pull request** that adds a directory (use your full name as the folder name) with an `aboutMe` file (feel free to make it a .txt or .md file) inside that describes your favorite current TV show.

Probably the easiest workflow for you is to:
1. **fork** this repository to your own GitHub account
2. **clone** the forked version down onto your local machine
3. Add an additional **remote** connection to the original repository

Now, whenever you make changes inside your personal directory, you can first **pull** any updates from the main repository to your local machine, commit your changes to the local repo, push those commits to your forked version on GitHub, and finally make a **pull request**.

You guys will be version-control masters by the end of this course because we'll use this repository to submit and review assignments. You can track the schedule and solutions in the [Assignment Calendar](assignment_calendar.md). Likewise, the algorithm challenges you'll be expected to complete can be found in the [Algorithms Calendar](AlgorithmChallenges/schedule.md).

Happy coding!
